Pigs don’t usually develop blisters as a result of foot and mouth disease. But sometimes blisters do appear on the: upper edge of the hoof where the skin and horn meet, snout and tongue. The clinical signs are indistinguishable from swine vesicular disease. Therefore if you suspect swine vesicular disease you must report your suspicions and treat the condition as suspected foot and mouth disease until laboratory tests prove otherwise.", management:"There is no treatment, pigs that are affected should be executed. \n\nVaccination (where applicable):\n\nIn endemic and high risk areas routine vaccination may be practised mainly to protect the breeding stock. Most FMD vaccines are produced in cell suspension cultures and inactivated by ethylenamine derivatives. An adjuvant is added to make them more potent. Oily adjuvants are used in swine. Vaccination in pigs is problematical. This is because protection is short-lived lasting only about six months. It is also partly because there are seven serotypes of FMD and protection against one leaves animals susceptible to the others. Vaccines must be multivalent (several serotypes) in most endemic regions. Since FMD is largely a winter disease, vaccination should be carried out in the autumn", other:"", src: "icons/livestockdiseases/pigs_fmd.jpg" },

Eradication by slaughter is usual in chickens and turkeys.\n\nPrevention:\n\nHygiene, quarantine, all-in/all-out production, etc. Minimise contact with wild birds, controlled marketing of recovered birds. Vaccination is not normally recommended because, although it may reduce losses initially, vaccinated birds may remain carriers if exposed to the infection. Vaccines have been used in recent outbreaks in Mexico and Pakistan. To be effective inactivated vaccines must be the right subtype for the particular situation (H5 will not protect against H7 and vice versa). In outbreaks a regime of slaughter, correct disposal of carcases, cleaning, disinfection, isolation, 21-day interval to re-stocking should be followed.
